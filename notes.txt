++++BONUS++++
Remake the map to use Numpy instead of python lists

----IDEA----
Lets say if there is 10 out of 10 tiles
the tiles where enemies can move should also split each tile into 10 more
This is to allow more than one enemy on a single tile
also to have smoother movement

----IDEA----
Creating a map:
1. Create an empty map ?x? big
2. If the map is 10x10 then it contains 100 tiles
3. Each tile can be selected and then assigned its tile type
4. Each map has to have a Start tile and an End tile
5. Start tile and the End tile has to be connected by a Path tile

----IDEA----
If Start tile has been placed, then make it impossible to add another one
Same with End tile

----IDEA----
Create the ability to place multiple Paths next to each other
One way that probably doesnt work is with a buffer zone between tiles
Perhaps a better way would be to add the ability to create a ghost wall on tiles NorthESW

----TODO----
1. Tiles
