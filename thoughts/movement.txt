Notes:
 * Each path consists of a sequence of tile XY locations

Ideas:
 * For movement each tile should further be split into 10, 20
 * While moving enemy needs to know next tile in sequence
This is so i can tell enemy that it needs to walk for example: halfway north then halfway east

* Could make a function that would convert which step of the sequence enemy is in into coords
