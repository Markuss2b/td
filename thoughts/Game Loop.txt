Game Loop:

	health = 1000
	alive_enemies = []
	towers = []
	while game:
		for path in paths:
			for enemy in alive_enemies:
				enemy_step()
				
			if spawner_enemies_left > 0:
				spawn_enemy()

				alive_enemies.append(new_enemy)
		
			for tower in all_towers:	
				tower_shoot()
				move_bullets()

# Enemy
def enemy_step():
	move_enemy along sequence....

	if enemy reached end:
		health = health - enemy_damage		


# Towers
def tower_shoot():
	Make new bullet with unchangeable target

def move_bullets(target):
	move bullet towards targets new location
	
	if hit:
		tower_all_bullets.remove_bullet()
		
		if target_health < 0:
			remove_enemy(target)





Towers:
	* Towers need a target(First enemy)

	----(HOW TO GET FIRST TARGET WITH MULTIPLE PATHS?--------
	* I guess you need to compare how many steps left an enemy has
	
	* Bullets each iteration move to enemies location with the shortest distance

	* What happens to the bullets after an enemy dies
