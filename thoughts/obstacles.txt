create a class in map
they have variables: name, top, left, width, height
They get placed with mouse cursor
Save all obstacles in a list
With arrow key left remove obstacle from list
Recreating path from file would probably have to have all obstacles with all variables

When hovering over map draw that obstacle following cursor ?
